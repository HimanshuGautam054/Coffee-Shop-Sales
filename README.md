# Coffee-Shop-Sales
Hello, GitHub community
I am excited to share a new project on Coffee Shop Sales Analysis using MS Excel.
In this project, I have completed: Data Modelling, Data Formatting, Data Cleaning, Data Processing, Data Analysis, Data Visualisation, Created Charts, Created Measures, Created Slicers, Created Reports, and a dashboard.

Sample Insights :
•	The peak period, when the largest sales are reported, is between 8 and 10 am.
•	The month of June records the biggest sales
•	Hell Kitchen was the location with the biggest sales, aside from Astonia and Lower Mannhaten.
•	The top five products are hot chocolate, gourmet brewed coffee, brewed Black tea, brewed chai tea, and barista espresso. 
•	Average order per person is 1.4
